# Palindrome
The definition of palindrome from Wiki is "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar."  So by definition, the empty string, all strings containing only 1 character, and containing 2 equal characters are palindromes.   In this problem, we will give you a string s, and a interger n. You can delete the string at most n charectors. Please tell use whether you can make the string become palindromes.
